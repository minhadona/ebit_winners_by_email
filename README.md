# giveaway_result_by_email

Tired of checking Ebit website to figure out if you're among the winners?
Set a cron job to run this script and receive the winners list by e-mail :)

## Getting started

This is a simple webscraping using the classic beautiful soup lib. Then we steal the whole table of winners available in their [website](https://company.ebit.com.br/concorra-premios/ultimos-ganhadores), format the table using pretty_html_table lib and mail to you! 


## First steps
You'll need
- a gmail account 
- recent version of python installed
- basic knowledge of cron (or app deploy on heroku, it's up to you)
